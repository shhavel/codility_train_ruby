# Write a function:

#     def solution(a)

# that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

# For example, given:
#   A[0] = 1
#   A[1] = 3
#   A[2] = 6
#   A[3] = 4
#   A[4] = 1
#   A[5] = 2

# the function should return 5.

# Assume that:

#         N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
#         each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

# Complexity:

#         expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
#         expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

# Elements of input arrays can be modified.
