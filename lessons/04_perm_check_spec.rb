# A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.

# A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

# For example, array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
#     A[3] = 2

# is a permutation, but array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3

# is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

# The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.

# Write a function:

#     int solution(int A[], int N);

# that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.

# For example, given array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
#     A[3] = 2

# the function should return 1.

# Given array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3

# the function should return 0.

# Assume that:

#         N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
#         each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

# Complexity:

#         expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
#         expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

# Elements of input arrays can be modified.
